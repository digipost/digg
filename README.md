Digipost Digg üç¨
===============================

This library contains general functionality developed by the Digipost team. It
is not meant as an replacement for other common and very useful general purpose libraries, as [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)
or [Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/), but to complement those. _Digg_ has grown from various encountered repetitive programming problems, which has been generalized and put into the library. The functionality found in _Digg_ is not specific to or coupled with the Digipost domain, and should be applicable for any project.

The term _"digg"_ is Norwegian jargon for tasty stuff, like candy.

## Getting to know Digg in 45 seconds

_Digg_ contains a lot of useful utilities implemented as static methods. The "entry point" for these methods are all classes with the prefix `Digg*`. An easy way to explore the API is to type `Digg` in your IDE, and let auto-completion show you what is available.
